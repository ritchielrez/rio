# rio - A modern terminal for the 21st century

## A working configuration of the rio terminal

### Why Rio?
Well, cross-platform terminals are really hard to fine. The ones that exist like - **Alacritty, Wezterm** etc are amazing.
But **Alacritty** does not have support for ligatures, and **Wezterm** has also some performance issues.
Here are some amazing features avalaible in **Rio**:  

- **Tabs:**  
Amazing feature to have. Windows does not have any good multiplexer like **tmux**, so having support for tabs in a cross-platform
terminal is crucial for me.

- **Vi mode:**  
I have not tried this feature, but it is a great feature to have in your terminal.

- **Rio is Fast:**  
This is the major feature which made me switch to a new terminal again. **Rio** is fast but also has a lot of features, unfortunately
no ligatures support yet it seems like!

Star this repository if you find my configuration useful, you can open an **issue or pull request** to suggest some changes if you want, but don't
expect this configuration to scale up to something big.
